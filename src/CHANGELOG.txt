v0.2.1 - 2011-10-24
- Config file:  renamed spawn to settings to avoid confusion with similarly named subsections
- Config file:  use-permissions defaults to false to avoid exceptions when running without perms we can recognize.  Want this plugin to run "out of the box" without tweaking in as many circumstances as possible
- spawnLimit now counts every passenger instead of treating the whole combo as one unit 

v0.2 - 2011-10-22
- Made it possible to spawn Items
- Redid configuration file, made it use lists
- Randomized direction entity faces when spawned (not the same as velocity)
- Allow for the inclusion of default parameters in alias (e.g. supercreeper could be creeper/a)
